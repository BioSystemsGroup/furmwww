             <td colspan="5">The development of any given biological
model is driven by the experimental context in which it will be used.
Hence, computer models are often over-fitted to a single, unique,
experimental context and fail to be useful in other situations.  To
solve this problem, multiple, separate models of a biological system
are required to adequately represent that system's behaviors.  This is
in stark contrast to the biological components to which these models
refer, which can be placed in almost any experimental context relevant
to their various behaviors.  The problem presents a fundamental
breakdown in the extent to which any computer model represents its
referent.  We present the basics of a modeling method, FURM
(Functional Unit Representation Method) that attempts to address this
breakdown by enforcing and encouraging the use of some basic
methodological principles in the development of any functional unit
model.
