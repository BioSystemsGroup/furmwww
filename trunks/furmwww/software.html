    <center><h1>Software</h1></center>

    <p>There is no software explicitly for FURM.  FURM is a
      <strong>method</strong> by which models are created.  The only
      software associated with FURM so far is the code for the ISL
      models and the experimental apparatus in which they sit.</p>

    <h2>Downloads</h2>
    <p>The ISL software will is not yet available for download.</p>

    <h2>Documentation</h2>

    <p>The only documentation we have so far is the content of our
      Technical Report and submitted papers, available in the <a
      href="./documents.html" target="_top">Documents</a> section.</p>

    <p>However, below are some UML-ish diagrams that help explain the
      structure of the software.  These diagrams have been
      purposefully simplified to get across the primary structure of
      the system.</p>

    <h2>Main Class Diagram</h2>

    <p>This is the class diagram for the experiment level of the ISL.
      This is the level at which experiments are set up, controlled,
      and logged.</p> <center><img alt="Main Class Diagram"
      src="./img/main_inheritance.png"></center>

    <h2>Reference Model Inheritance Diagram</h2>

    <p>This shows the rather simple inheritance relationships used in
      the RefModel.  The simplicity of this diagram is not really
      deceiving because this model really is just a simple
      mathematical function evaluated at each time step.</p>

      src="./img/refModel_inheritance.png"></center>

    <h2>Articulated Model Inheritance</h2>

    <p>The ArtModel is clearly the most complicated component of the
      ISL.  When looking at this and the subsequent constituents
      diagrams, refer to the description of the modelon the <a
      href="./iprl.html" target="_top">ISL</a> page.</p> <center><img
      alt="ArtModel Inheritance Diagram"
      src="./img/artModel_inheritance.png"></center>

    <h2>Articulated Model Constituents</h2>

    <p>This diagram lists the classes whose objects participate in the
      evaluation of the ArtModel.  It indicates run-time
      composition.</p> <center><img alt="ArtModel Constituents"
      src="./img/artModel_constituents.png"></center>

    <h2>Model Utilities Inheritance</h2>

    <p>The model utilities are miscellaneous things we had to create
      to augment the Swarm framework to support the ISL.  Other ABM
      packages have analogues to many of these components and when the
      ISL is ported to another platform, this package is expected to
      change accordingly.</p> <center><img alt="ModelUtils
      Inheritance" src="./img/modelUtils_inheritance.png"></center>

    <h2>Graph Package Inheritance</h2>

    <p>This is a modified version of a directed graph library
      contribution to Swarm.  There are a number of changes we made to
      the API and we added some extra functionality.  But, the
      structure is the same.</p> <center><img alt="Graph Inheritance"
      src="./img/graph_inheritance.png"></center>

    <h2>Local Random Constituents</h2>

    <p>These are a few random number distributions are provided in the
      global scope for use in the various models. They're "local" to
      the ISL and distinct from the default distributions provided by
      Swarm.</p> <center><img alt="LocalRandom Constituents"
      src="./img/LocalRandom_constituents.png"></center>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <ul>

      <li>The ISL is written using a combination of Objective-C and
        C++.  Hence, the elements of these diagrams do not translate
        as directly as they would to Java.</li>

      <li>We are in the process of making several extensions to the
        model, including adding hepatocytes, endothelial cells, more
        solute types, and a re-architected ExperAgent.  So, these
        diagrams are already slightly out-of-date.  But, there should
        be enough here to present the gist.</li>

      <li>The GML (Graph Modeling Language) class is just an
        abstraction allowing the ArtModel to read the directed graph
        of sinusoidal segments from a GML file.  It's not clear that
        GML is the best format for this application; but, it is much
        more self-descriptive than a simple adjacency matrix and it
        can include visualization information.  We intend to add
        visualization in the near future.  In the meantime, we
        manipulate the graphs with tools like Tulip and GVF.</li>

      <li>We also have a lobule architecture specific parametrized way
        of specifying graphs called the LobuleSpec.  There doesn't
        seem to be a good graph generation/evolution tool available
        out there anywhere.  GVF might be a good base framework in
        which to fold such a tool.</li>

      <li>At the moment, we are not using HDF5 as anything other than
        a data format.  But as the data for any given experiment gets
        more complicated, we expect to use more features from HDF5.
        Some examples of how the data is expected to get complicated
        are: multiple in vitro measures (other than outflow profiles),
        intra- as well as the current inter-subject data, measures
        taken at multiple resolutions of the in vitro system, etc.
        It's also possible that the amount of data will grow very
        large.  These are the issues that justify the use of HDF5, in
        spite of the fact that we're not putting it to good use at
        present.</li>

      <li>Because this is a prototype and is really intended to help
        us develop FURM (which is a <strong>generic</strong> method),
        the architecture of this model allows all sorts of bad
        programming practices.  For example, there is alot of
        crosstalk between the packages and it is sometimes
        questionable whether certain attributes belong in certain
        classes.  As FURM is refined, the ISL will be augmented with
        more and more automation and mechanisms for automatically
        making decisions.  This automation will demonstrate the
        feasibility of FURM and it will likely produce clinically
        useful in silico models of the liver.  But, the expectation is
        that the ISL will be reimplemented after its usefulness is
        demonstrated.</li>

    </ul>

    <p>We also have a mailing list for the discussion of FURM-related
    projects, software, design goals, and all the peripheral subjects
    like tools, techniques, etc.  If you would like to stay informed
