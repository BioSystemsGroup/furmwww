        designed for the simulation of engineered systems, both
        hardware and software.  It's actor-oriented approach
        facilitates the graphical construction, quasi-autonomy, and
        integration of components based on heterogeneous models of
        computation
        (so-called <a href="http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/ptolemyII/ptIIlatest/ptII/doc/codeDoc/index.html">Directors</a>)
        as well as the semi-automated model-checking of composed
        models.  Such facilities turn out to be useful for biological
        modeling and we have begun designing more biologically
        relevant Ptolemy II models and actors.</td>

        <td>Acetominophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity in mice is a reference
        model for drug induced liver injury in humans.  Because APAP
        toxicity involves many positive and negative feedback loops
        across many scales and aspects, it is not clear which of those
        networks are essential players in the toxicity cascade and
        which are mere correlations.  This project is a collaborative
        effort between the <a href="http://biosystems.ucsf.edu">BioSystems Group</a> at UCSF, <a href="http://www.surgery.usc.edu/divisions/hep/cv-kaplowitzneil.html">Neil
        Kaplowitz</a>, and <a href="http://pibbs.usc.edu/faculty/profile/?fid=198">Laurie
        DeLeve</a> both at USC to build falsifiable mechanistic alternative
        models to help decouple the correlations from the causal
        influences.

The glossary is an attempt to hone in on definitions of terms as we would like to see them used.  None of these definitions are intended to be universal or authoritative.  Indeed, we expect them to change daily.  But, presenting them gives some stability to the other work and the communication required for these projects.
