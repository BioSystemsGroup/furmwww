   <center><h1>ISL:  In Silico (Isolated Perfused Rat) Liver</h1></center>

   <p>The ISL is the first functional unit representation being
developed with FURM.  We started developing both FURM and the IRPL
simultaneously because no <em>method</em> is ever useful without
having some examples of its product.</p>

   <p>We chose the liver as our functional unit for this first
representation for a couple of reasons.  It is relatively homogenous
(various parts of the liver look and act the same).  There is a large
amount of data of different types to validate against.  And there are
relatively stable pedigreed models of liver function out there.</p>

   <p>A more complete description of this model suite can be found in
the Initial Technical Report for FURM on the <a
href="./documents.html">Documents</a> page.  But, we'll describe it
briefly here.</p>

   <table width="100%">
    <tr>
       <td>
       <p><font size="+2">Liver Structure</font></p>

       <p>A liver is built of several lobes, each made up of hundreds
of lobules.  Each lobule consists of several acini organized around
terminal afferent vessels. Anacinus is a network of sinusoids that
separate meshworks of one-cell thick plates made up of hepatocytes.
Intra-acinar hepatocytes exhibit location-specific properties.</td>

       <td colspan="2"><p>The ISL models were set up to mimic
specific wet lab experiments where a rat liver is perfused with a fluid
containing various solutes.  Some of these solutes are extracted by the

       <p>The model suite consists of three <em>in silico</em> models:
          <ul>
             <li>DatModel -- A wrapper for data taken from the wet lab
             experiments.</li>

             <li>RefModel -- A two-compartment model developed by
             Michael Roberts and his colleagues at the University of
             Queensland, Queensland Australia.</li>

             <li>ArtModel -- Our agent-based model.</li>

       </td>
     </tr>

     <tr>
     <td colspan="2">
     <p>An experiment agent (ExperAgent) executes all three of these
models in tandem.  The ExperAgent is responsible for:
       <ol>
       <li>managing the resources (inputs, memory, etc.)  required for
           each experiment, </li>
       <li>controlling the models, </li>
       <li>taking data from the models, </li>
       <li>progressing from one experimental setup to the next, </li>
       <li>scoring each model against some performance measure, and </li>
       <li>acquiring telemetric data from the experiments.</li>
      </ol>
     </p>

      <p>This set of requirements allows for a wide array of
       experiments.  Experiments are treated as <strong>discovery
        mechanisms</strong>, not validation exercises.  In that context,
       one might want to explore the behavior of the 3 different models
       in response to variations of input.  An hypothesis might be that
       the reference model is more stable than the articulated model.
       An experiment would then be designed to execute the three models
       using varying inputs (changes in the bolus times or delivery
       profiles).  A set of measurement devices would be hooked up to
       the ExperAgent that measured the various observables believed to
       indicate stability.  A scoring device would be hooked up to the
       ExperAgent to measure the stability of each model based on those
       measurements.  In order to vary the inputs, the ExperAgent will
       need an input device and some characterization of that device
       indicating its tolerances, limits, and "normal" usage as well as
       some heuristics as to how to employ the device.  The ExperAgent
       can then vary the inputs according to some regular pattern
       (quantities and flow rates that start at an initial point and
       progress by a constant interval).  Or it could use some search
       algorithm to target instability indicators evidenced by the
       stability measures.</p>

      <p>Another potential experiment might be intended to discover
       how a structural change in one or more of the models might
       affect their behavior given the same inputs.  In this case, the
       ExperAgent would insert/remove/change the structural component
       in automated ways and measure their output.</p>

      <p>Techniques like parameter sweeps, sensitivity analysis, and
       adaptive simulation are all subcategories of these types of
       experiments and are effected through the ExperAgent.

      <p>The following figures indicate the structure of the apparatus
       in different experiments.</p>

      <p>These requirements also encourage optimization for the
       reusability of the models and the ancillary modules being used
       to carry out the experiments.</p>

      <p>For example, because measurements have to be taken many times
       and applied to many different models and then subsequently
       compared, efficiency dictates that the module implementing the
       measurement be independent of both the subject (the ExperAgent)
       and the object (the model or other component being measured) of
       the measurement.  This isolates the code that implements the
       measurement and encourages that all measures are implemented
       with the same or similar interfaces, as well.</p>

      <p>The ISL has two primary objectives:
       <ol>
       <li>Demonstrate the efficacy and feasibility of FURM as a method for developing functional unit models, and</li>
       <li>Provide a platform by which Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) can be used to augment the other modeling techniques being used to study the liver.</li>
       </ol>

       satisfy these two objectives, see the project <a
