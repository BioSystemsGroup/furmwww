    <center><h1>Plans and Schedules</h1></center>

    <p>FURM is basic research.  The project's goals are aggressive and
      even if it succeeds, it is likely to change drastically as we
      develop it.  In addition, it is clear that there are many
      related research paths to be explored.  Some of those paths
      involve the application of techniques that are successful in
      other disciplines (like fuzzy systems), some involve building
      bridges between seemingly incommensurate techniques (like
      between mathematical modeling and agent-based modeling), and
      some involving esoteric topics (like automata theory).  As such,
      it's difficult to tell where it will end up or what might spin
      off of work being done on it.</p>

    <p>However, the goals are clear enough to derive near- and
      medium-term objectives and requirements.  The management of the
      project toward those objectives will follow the same philosophy
      as the FURM method, itself.  It will be integrative, extensible,
      and open-ended.  The point is not to dive down deep and develop
      any one technique, model, or technology.  The point is to
      provide as much context and navigability to the practice of
      biological modeling as possible.  This means pointing out and
      facilitating the relationships between the many different tools
      and methods used and discovered by biological modelers.  The end
      result will be a web or <strong>network</strong> of techniques
      that improve the efficacy and efficiency of a modeling effort,
      regardless of the particular domain.</p>

    <p>The current near-term objective is to use FURM (as it stands)
      to continue developing the IPRL so that it can adequately
      account for, and possibly predict, the dynamics of the liver as
      it processes incoming blood.  The milestones toward that
      objective consist primarily of building a mechanism for
      searching and analyzing the space of <strong>possible</strong>
      models of liver dynamics and structure (biotic and abiotic,
      healthy and diseased).  If FURM can bring the IPRL to this
      point, then it will have demonstrated its usefulness and
      feasibility.</p>

    <p>That said, here is our latest working gantt chart.  This
      changes so much it's almost not worth the overhead.  But, it
      allows us to scope where we expect to be over the next few
      months and keeps development disciplined.</p>
